## Starting Context Router

> See `./references/shared-patterns.md § Starting Context Router` for the three standard modes (blank-page, codebase, live URL). Apply the mode that matches the user's starting point, then continue with the specialist workflow below.

---

## 0. Pre-Flight: Read Strategic Context

> See `./references/shared-patterns.md § Pre-Flight` for the standard context-reading sequence. Ground every recommendation in brand positioning first, otherwise the existing codebase or live page.

---

## Reference Lookup Protocol

> **Pitch templates and frameworks** have been split into individual files for progressive disclosure.
>
> **Index**: `./references/frameworks-index.csv`
> **Files**: `./references/frameworks/{file}`
>
> **How to use**:
> 1. Read `./references/frameworks-index.csv` to find the right framework by `pitch_type`, `best_for`, or `tags`.
> 2. Load only the specific file(s) needed for the current task from `./references/frameworks/`.
> 3. Do NOT load all framework files at once -- load only what the task requires.
>
> **Pitch type quick reference**:
> | Need | pitch_type filter | Key file(s) |
> |---|---|---|
> | Cold email to journalist | Email Outreach | `cold-pitch-template.md`, `pitch-types.md` |
> | Follow-up after pitch | Email Outreach | `follow-up-sequence.md` |
> | Press announcement | Media Relations | `press-release-template.md` |
> | Interview preparation | Media Relations | `spokesperson-preparation.md` |
> | HARO / source request | Email Outreach | `haro-response-template.md` |

## Path Resolution: Campaign vs Standalone

**Campaign mode** — working within a named campaign:
  → Save to `./brands/{brand-slug}/campaigns/{type}-{campaign-slug}/channels/pr/content/`
  → Read campaign strategy at `./brands/{brand-slug}/campaigns/{type}-{campaign-slug}/strategy.md`

**Standalone mode** — evergreen or independent work:
  → Save to `./brands/{brand-slug}/channels/pr/content/`

**Legacy fallback** — old directory structure detected:
  → Save to `./brands/{brand-slug}/campaigns/pr/`
  → Suggest migration to new structure

If unsure which mode, ask: "Is this part of a specific campaign, or standalone work?"

---

## 1. Digital PR Strategy

### 1.1 PR Objectives

| Objective | Metrics | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Brand awareness | Media mentions, impressions, share of voice | Ongoing |
| Backlink acquisition | Referring domains, DA lift, link quality | 3-6 months |
| Credibility and trust | Tier-1 placements, expert citations, awards | 6-12 months |
| Referral traffic | Visits from earned media, engagement on referral | Per campaign |
| Thought leadership | Bylines, speaking invitations, podcast features | 6-12 months |
| Crisis preparedness | Response time, sentiment recovery | Always ready |

### 1.2 PR-SEO Integration

Digital PR is the most sustainable link building strategy. Bridge to marketing-seo for: link value assessment (DA/DR, dofollow vs nofollow, placement quality), anchor text coordination (natural distribution across PR-earned links), target page alignment (pitch stories that naturally link to priority SEO pages), topical authority (consistent niche coverage signals expertise), and content synergy (data studies serve as linkable assets for broader link building). Every PR campaign should have a link building goal alongside its media goal.

### 1.3 Media Tiers

| Tier | Examples | Value | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | National newspapers, major broadcast, top industry pubs | Massive reach, high DA backlinks | Very high |
| Tier 2 | Regional press, mid-size industry pubs, popular podcasts | Strong reach, good backlinks | Medium-high |
| Tier 3 | Niche blogs, local press, smaller podcasts, newsletters | Targeted reach, relevant backlinks | Medium |
| Tier 4 | Community sites, forums, micro-publications | Niche relevance, conversation starters | Low |

Build from Tier 3-4 upward. Early wins build a portfolio that unlocks higher tiers.

> For pitch email templates and outreach scripts, look up the appropriate framework by `pitch_type` in `./references/frameworks-index.csv` and load the specific file from `./references/frameworks/`. For PR benchmarks and KPI targets, see `./references/benchmarks.md`. For evolving best practices, see `./references/best-practices.md`.

## 2. Media Relations

### 2.1 Building a Media List

1. **Define the beat**: What topic does this story cover? Who writes about it?
2. **Identify publications**: List relevant outlets by tier. Prioritize outlets the target audience reads.
3. **Find journalists**: Search bylines, use X/LinkedIn, check media databases (Muck Rack, Cision, Prowly, Anewstip).
4. **Verify contact info**: Confirm emails are current. Check recent articles to confirm active beat coverage.
5. **Segment the list**: Tier by priority. Note pitch preferences and recent coverage angles.

Media list template: `| Name | Outlet | Beat | Tier | Email | Twitter/X | Recent Article | Pitch Angle | Status |`

Aim for 30-50 contacts per campaign. Quality over quantity.

### 2.2 Relationship Building

- **Engage before you pitch**: Follow journalists on social media. Share and comment on their work. Build familiarity over weeks.
- **Be a resource**: Offer expert commentary, data, or access without asking for coverage.
- **Deliver on promises**: If you offer an exclusive, honor it. If you promise data, deliver fast.
- **Maintain post-coverage**: Thank them. Share the article. Stay in touch.

### 2.3 Pitch Timing

| Strategy | When to Use | Lead Time |
|---|---|---|
| Newsjacking | Breaking news relevant to brand expertise | Hours -- same day |
| Seasonal / holiday | Predictable annual hooks | 4-8 weeks |
| Product launch | New product, feature, or service | 2-4 weeks |
| Data / research | Original study or survey results | 2-3 weeks |
| Trend commentary | Emerging industry trend | 1-2 weeks |
| Embargo | Major news, exclusive access | 1-2 weeks before release |

Best days: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am in journalist's timezone. Avoid Mondays, Fridays, major news days.

---

## 3. Press Releases

### 3.1 Structure

```
HEADLINE (Active voice, newsworthy, under 80 characters)
Subheadline (Expands with a key detail)
DATELINE -- CITY, State (YYYY-MM-DD) --
Lead paragraph: Who, what, when, where, why in 2-3 sentences.
Second paragraph: Supporting detail, context, significance.
Quote: "..." -- Name, Title, Company.
Body: Additional details, data, background. Most important to least.
Optional second quote from customer, partner, or analyst.
CTA: Where to learn more, sign up, or get involved.
### About {Company}
{Boilerplate: 2-3 sentences.}
### Media Contact
{Name} | {Email} | {Phone}
```

### 3.2 Writing Guidelines

- **Newsworthiness first**: Funding rounds, major partnerships, original data, significant milestones qualify. Internal promotions and minor features do not.
- **Inverted pyramid**: Most important information first. Each paragraph stands alone if the rest were cut.
- **Quotes add insight**: Quotes that restate facts waste space -- use them for opinion, vision, and personality that only a human source can provide.
- **Data and specifics**: Numbers and concrete claims outperform vague superlatives.
- **No jargon or hype**: Write for the journalist's audience. 400-600 words.

### 3.3 Modern Enhancements

Embed or link to high-resolution images, video, and infographics (visual assets increase pickup 2-3x). Include charts or statistics journalists can cite. Optimize headline for search with target keywords. Write a tweetable headline and 2-3 social-ready pull quotes.

### 3.4 Distribution Strategy

| Method | Best For | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Targeted pitch (email) | Tier 1-2, exclusive/embargo stories | Free |
| Wire service (PR Newswire, Business Wire) | Broad distribution, compliance | $400-$2,000+ |
| Niche/budget wire (EIN Presswire, Send2Press) | Trade press, budget distribution | $100-$500 |
| Press page | Always-on availability, SEO | Free |

Targeted pitch for high-value stories. Wire only when broad distribution or compliance requires it. Always pair wire with direct outreach.

---

## 4. Journalist Outreach

### 4.1 Email Pitch Templates

All pitches follow the same structure: compelling subject line, personalized opening referencing recent work, the story with 2-3 key details/data points, what you can offer (data, interview, exclusive), brief signature. Full template library lives in `./references/frameworks/` -- look up the right template by `pitch_type` in `./references/frameworks-index.csv` (e.g., `cold-pitch-template.md`, `pitch-types.md`).

**Exclusive Offer**: Subject: "Exclusive: {newsworthy claim}". Offer unpublished data or announcement. Explain fit for their beat. Bullet key details. Offer exclusive access, expert commentary, or interview.

**Data Story**: Subject: "New data: {surprising finding}". Lead with study scope and sample size. 3 bullet findings with numbers. Offer full report, charts, methodology, expert commentary.

**Expert Commentary**: Subject: "Expert source: {trending topic}". Reference their recent article. Introduce spokesperson with credentials. Provide 2-3 sentences of quotable take. Offer call or written quote on deadline.

**Trend Piece**: Subject: "Trend: {pattern} -- data and expert available". Describe the trend with 2-3 supporting data points. Offer spokesperson with specific credibility.

**Product Launch**: Subject: "{Brand} launches {product} -- {key benefit}". One sentence on what it does and why it matters. 2-3 differentiators. Offer demo, samples, founder interview, press kit.

### 4.2 Follow-Up Cadence

| Touchpoint | Timing | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Initial pitch | Day 0 | Full pitch per templates |
| Follow-up 1 | Day 3-4 | Brief, add a new angle or data point |
| Follow-up 2 | Day 7-8 | Short, reference a timely hook or their recent article |
| Move on | After 2 follow-ups | Do not follow up again on the same pitch |

Avoid bare "just checking in" follow-ups -- journalists ignore them. Every touchpoint should add a new angle, data point, or timely hook.

### 4.3 HARO / Connectively / Qwoted Response Strategy

Response speed and quality win placements. Framework: (1) Respond within 1-2 hours -- first responders get priority. (2) Lead with credentials: "I'm {Name}, {Title} at {Brand}. I've {experience}." (3) Answer directly in 2-4 quotable sentences. (4) Add a unique angle -- data, contrarian take, first-hand experience. (5) Include headshot and bio. (6) Keep under 200 words.

Set up keyword alerts. Prepare boilerplate bios. Track wins and follow up with journalists who use quotes.

### 4.4 Podcast Guest Pitching

Pitch structure: Reference a specific episode with genuine compliment. Propose a topic with 3 specific talking points (not generic). Include 2-sentence bio with credentials. Mention previous appearances. Target podcasts the brand's audience listens to. Check guest history to ensure the topic is fresh.

---

## 5. Digital PR Campaigns

### 5.1 Data-Driven Studies

The highest-ROI digital PR tactic. Process: (1) Identify a question the audience and journalists want answered. (2) Gather data -- survey (500+ respondents), proprietary data analysis, or novel compilation of public data. (3) Find the surprising, counterintuitive, or debate-settling story. (4) Package as branded report with methodology, findings, and visualizations. (5) Create assets: full report, summary blog, infographic, social graphics, press release. (6) Pitch leading with the most surprising finding. Offer exclusive early access to Tier 1.

**Survey specifics**: Minimum 500 respondents (1,000+ for national claims). Clear methodology and margin of error. Platforms: Pollfish, SurveyMonkey Audience, Prolific. Cost: $500-$5,000. Design questions for headline-worthy "X% of people believe..." findings.

### 5.2 Creative Campaign Formats

| Format | Description | Link Building Value |
|---|---|---|
| Data study | Original research with visualized findings | Very high |
| Expert roundup | Curated insights from 10-20 industry experts | High |
| Interactive tool | Calculator, quiz, or map with utility | Very high |
| Newsjack report | Rapid analysis tied to breaking news | High |
| Annual index | Recurring yearly rankings or benchmarks | Very high |
| Visual asset | Infographic, map, or chart for embedding | Medium-high |

Interactive content (calculators, maps, quizzes) earns coverage because journalists can embed or link to them as resources. Design for shareability, embed-ability, and evergreen value.

### 5.3 Newsjacking Playbook

1. **Monitor**: Google Alerts, Feedly, X lists, industry newsletters for breaking stories.
2. **Assess fit**: Genuine expertise? Real value to add? If not, skip.
3. **React fast**: Draft commentary within 1-2 hours. Speed is everything.
4. **Pitch**: Email journalists covering the story. Subject: "Expert source available: {topic}."
5. **Provide quotes**: Pre-written, quotable, 2-3 sentences. Include credentials.
6. **Depth follow-up**: If the story has legs, publish a longer analysis and pitch as follow-up resource.

---

## 6. Crisis Communications

### 6.1 Crisis Preparation

Every brand should have a crisis plan with: **Crisis team** (spokesperson, decision maker, comms lead, legal, social lead -- with backups and contact info). **Crisis tiers** (Tier 1 Minor: negative review, 24hr response, comms lead approval. Tier 2 Moderate: viral complaint or negative press, 4-8hr response, comms + decision maker. Tier 3 Major: product failure, data breach, legal/safety issue, 1-2hr response, full team). **Holding statements** (general awareness, product issue, data/privacy -- each acknowledging the situation, expressing seriousness, and promising updates). **Communication channels** in priority: direct to affected parties, website/blog, social media, then media. **Escalation contacts** for stakeholders, legal, insurance, technical leads.

### 6.2 Response Framework: AIRR

**Acknowledge**: Within 1-2 hours. Confirm awareness. Do not speculate or assign blame. Use holding statement.

**Investigate**: Gather facts internally. Document everything. Brief crisis team. Prepare factual timeline.

**Respond**: Full public response when facts are clear. Own the mistake. Explain the fix. State prevention measures. Be specific -- vague apologies backfire.

**Recover**: Follow up with affected parties. Post-mortem when appropriate. Monitor sentiment. Rebuild trust through action.

### 6.3 Social Media Crisis Management

Do not delete negative posts (unless policy violations). Respond publicly first, then DM for resolution. Pause all scheduled content. Monitor in real time (Brandwatch, Mention, Google Alerts). One voice -- single approved account or spokesperson. Assume everything is screenshotted.

### 6.4 Stakeholder Communication

| Audience | Channel | Timing | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| Affected customers | Email, in-app | First priority | What happened, impact, what to do |
| All customers | Email, website | Same day | Brief, factual, reassuring |
| Employees | Internal comms | Before external | Full context, talking points |
| Media | Press statement | After affected parties | Official statement, spokesperson |
| Partners/investors | Direct | Same day | Impact assessment, response plan |

---

## 7. Brand Reputation Management

### 7.1 Online Reputation Monitoring

Monitor: brand name (exact + misspellings), key personnel names, product names, competitor mentions (share of voice), industry keywords. Tools: Google Alerts (free minimum), Mention, Brand24, Brandwatch, Meltwater.

### 7.2 Review Response Strategy

| Review Type | Response Approach | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| Positive (4-5 stars) | Thank by name, reference specific detail, invite back | 24-48 hours |
| Neutral (3 stars) | Thank, acknowledge concern, offer to improve | 24 hours |
| Negative (1-2 stars) | Apologize, take responsibility, offer resolution, move to DM | 12-24 hours |
| Fake/spam | Flag for removal, respond factually if public | Same day |

Respond to every review -- silence signals indifference. Avoid arguing publicly (it escalates and audiences side with the reviewer). Offer specific solutions and follow up to confirm resolution.

### 7.3 Thought Leadership Positioning

Build founder or key executives as industry authorities: **LinkedIn** (3-5 posts/week, 1-2 articles/month -- bridge to marketing-social). **Speaking** (panels, events, webinars -- start local, build to national). **Bylines** (opinion pieces in industry publications). **Podcast guesting** (1-2/month, see Section 4.4). **Awards** (industry awards and "best of" lists -- credibility plus backlinks). **Original research** (publish data under the expert's name, Section 5.1).

---

## 8. Media Kit and Press Page

### 8.1 Media Kit Contents

Company overview (2-3 paragraphs: what, founding story, mission, differentiator). Key facts (founded, HQ, team size, customers, 3-5 milestones). Leadership bios (2-3 sentences each with headshot download links). Brand assets (logo pack in PNG + SVG, brand colors as hex, fonts, usage guidelines). Recent press coverage table (date, outlet, headline, link). Awards and recognition. Media contact with response time commitment.

### 8.2 Press Page

Host at `/press` or `/newsroom`: company overview, downloadable assets, leadership headshots and bios, press releases (reverse chronological), recent coverage links, media contact. Update monthly -- an outdated press page signals an inactive brand.

---

## 9. Spokesperson Preparation

### 9.1 Key Messages Framework

For every media opportunity, prepare: **Core message** (1 sentence -- the single most important takeaway). **Supporting messages** (3 max, each with proof: data, example, or story). **Proof points** (stats, case studies, third-party validation). **Bridging phrases** ("What's important to understand is...", "The real story here is...", "What our customers tell us is...", "Let me put that in context..."). **Off-limits topics** with suggested redirects.

### 9.2 Interview Preparation

**Before**: Research journalist and outlet. Review recent articles. Prepare 3-5 key messages, practice each in under 30 seconds. **During**: Lead with strongest message. Bridge to redirect. Provide specific examples and data. Speak in quotable sentences. Pause before difficult questions.

### 9.3 Handling Difficult Questions

| Question Type | Technique |
|---|---|
| Hostile or loaded | Reframe premise, then bridge: "I'd characterize it differently. What's actually happening is..." |
| Speculative | Decline, offer facts: "I can't speculate, but what I can tell you is..." |
| Off-topic | Acknowledge, redirect: "That's fair. What's most relevant here is..." |
| "No comment" trap | Never say it: "We're not ready to discuss that yet, but here's what we can share..." |
| Competitor comparison | Focus on strengths: "I can't speak for them, but what our customers value is..." |

---

## 11. Modern and Emerging PR Practices

**AI in PR**: AI accelerates monitoring, drafting, media list building, and pitch personalization. Human review is mandatory -- journalists detect and penalize generic AI outreach. Review and edit AI drafts before sending -- journalists detect and penalize generic AI outreach, which damages your credibility and the brand's.

**Digital-first PR**: Prioritize online publications (backlinks, referral traffic), social amplification, podcast features, newsletter mentions, and search visibility over traditional masthead prestige.

**Podcast PR**: Long-form exposure (30-60 min), direct trust transfer, evergreen discoverability. Target 2-4 appearances/month. Repurpose clips across social.

**LinkedIn PR strategy**: Founder posts outperform brand pages 5-10x. Document posts and carousels for data/frameworks. Comment on journalist posts for visibility. LinkedIn newsletters and articles for native distribution indexed by Google.

**Creator PR**: Industry creators (YouTubers, newsletter operators, podcast hosts) often drive more traffic and trust than traditional media in niches. Lead with a story, not a sales pitch. Bridge to marketing-influencer for paid partnerships.

**AI Search and PR (GEO)**: Generative Engine Optimization is the practice of ensuring your brand and coverage appear in AI-generated answers from ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Claude. PR directly influences AI citations.

- **Coverage becomes AI training data**: Every placement in a reputable publication becomes a citation source for AI models. Prioritize placements in authoritative, frequently-cited outlets even over high-traffic niche sites.
- **Brand entity building**: AI models associate entities (brands, people, concepts). Consistent brand mentions across authoritative press strengthen your brand entity, increasing the likelihood AI answers will cite or reference your brand.
- **Press release optimization for GEO**: Write clear, quotable statements with definitive facts and statistics. AI models extract and cite verbatim text. Include structured data in digital press releases. Publish on your own press page with schema markup (NewsArticle, Organization).
- **Thought leader citations**: Executive bylines and expert quotes in press become citation sources. When AI answers "who is an expert in [topic]," consistent press mentions establish that association.
- **Original data as AI citation magnet**: Data studies and research reports (Section 5.1) are highly cited by AI models because they contain unique information unavailable elsewhere. This is the single most effective PR tactic for GEO.

**GEO metrics for PR**:
- AI citation frequency: How often does your brand appear in AI answers in your category?
- Share of AI mentions vs competitors: Track how often AI answers reference your brand vs competitors.
- Track Perplexity and ChatGPT referral traffic: Monitor analytics for traffic from AI platforms.

Bridge to marketing-seo for technical GEO implementation. PR provides the authoritative mentions; SEO provides the structured data and entity optimization.

## 14. Response Protocol

When the user requests PR work:

1. **Read brand context and SOSTAC** (Section 0) when available; otherwise proceed from the repo, newsroom assets, live website or profile footprint, or user-provided context as appropriate.
2. **Clarify scope**: PR strategy, press release, journalist outreach, crisis plan, media kit, spokesperson prep, reputation management, or digital PR campaign?
3. **Assess current state**: Check the resolved path (see Path Resolution) for prior deliverables.
4. **Deliver actionable output**: Specific press releases, pitch templates, media lists, crisis plans, and campaign briefs -- never vague advice.
5. **Save deliverables**: Write all outputs to the resolved path (see Path Resolution).
6. **Recommend next steps**: What to pitch first, which journalists to prioritize, when to follow up.

### When to Escalate

- SEO link building beyond PR-earned links -- route to marketing-seo.
- Paid creator partnerships or influencer campaigns -- route to marketing-influencer.
- Social media content calendar and community management -- route to marketing-social.
- Blog posts, case studies, or content beyond press releases -- route to marketing-content.
- Email sequences for media nurture or stakeholder communication -- route to marketing-email.
- Legal review of crisis response or press statements -- recommend legal counsel.
- No brand presence yet (no product, no website) -- recommend foundational setup before PR.
