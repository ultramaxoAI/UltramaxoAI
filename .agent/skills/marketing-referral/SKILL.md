## Path Resolution: Campaign vs Standalone

**Campaign mode** — working within a named campaign:
  → Save to `./brands/{brand-slug}/campaigns/{type}-{campaign-slug}/referral/`
  → Read campaign strategy at `./brands/{brand-slug}/campaigns/{type}-{campaign-slug}/strategy.md`

**Standalone mode** — evergreen or independent work:
  → Save to `./brands/{brand-slug}/operations/referral/`

**Legacy fallback** — old directory structure detected:
  → Save to `./brands/{brand-slug}/campaigns/referral/`
  → Suggest migration to new structure

If unsure which mode, ask: "Is this part of a specific campaign, or standalone work?"

## 1. Referral Program Design

### 1.1 Referral Program Types

| Type | How It Works | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| One-sided | Only the referrer gets a reward | Simple setup, loyalty-focused, low-margin products |
| Two-sided | Both referrer and referred get a reward | Maximum conversion, SaaS, subscriptions, marketplaces |
| Tiered | Rewards increase with number of successful referrals | Power referrers, gamification, community-driven brands |
| Milestone | Rewards unlock at specific thresholds (3, 5, 10 referrals) | Sustained engagement, preventing one-and-done behavior |
| Community | Referrals benefit a shared pool or cause (charity donation, community unlock) | Mission-driven brands, community-first products |

**Default recommendation**: Two-sided for most products. The referred person needs a reason to act, and the referrer needs a reason to share. One-sided programs have 30-50% lower conversion rates on the referred side.

### 1.2 Incentive Structures

| Incentive | Examples | Best For | Margin Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cash / gift cards | $10 per referral, $25 Visa card | Universal appeal, high-ticket products | Direct cost per acquisition |
| Account credit | $15 credit toward next purchase | Retention + acquisition, recurring products | Lower effective cost (not all credits redeemed) |
| Free months / subscription | 1 month free for both parties | SaaS, subscriptions, memberships | Deferred cost, high perceived value |
| Feature unlocks | Premium features for 30 days, extra storage | Freemium products, feature-gated SaaS | Near-zero marginal cost |
| Physical rewards | Branded merchandise, products, exclusive items | Lifestyle brands, high-engagement communities | Variable cost, high perceived value |
| Tiered / stacked | 1 referral = sticker, 3 = t-shirt, 10 = lifetime access | Gamified programs, power referrers | Scales with referrer value |
| Donation | $5 donated to a charity per referral | Mission-driven brands, socially conscious audiences | Fixed cost, brand alignment |

**Choosing the right incentive**: Match the incentive to the product's economics. If customer lifetime value is $500, a $25 two-sided incentive ($50 total) is a 10% acquisition cost -- strong. If LTV is $30, the same incentive is unsustainable. Rule of thumb: keep total referral cost at 10-25% of LTV.

### 1.3 Referral Mechanics

**Unique referral links**: Every user gets a personalized link (e.g., `brand.com/ref/username`). Tracked via cookies or server-side. Standard attribution window: 30-90 days. Easiest to implement and share.

**Referral codes**: Unique alphanumeric codes (e.g., SARAH25). Entered at checkout or signup. Works across channels including offline. Pair with a discount for the referred user to increase code usage.

**In-app sharing**: Native share buttons within the product. Pre-written messages for email, SMS, WhatsApp, social. Share at moments of delight (after achievement, after positive experience, after onboarding completion). One-tap sharing reduces friction dramatically.

**Email invites**: Users enter friend email addresses directly. Brand sends the invitation on their behalf. Include personalization from the referrer. Highest intent signal but highest friction.

**QR codes**: Physical referral cards or in-app QR for offline sharing. Useful for retail, events, and local businesses.

### 1.4 Viral Coefficient Optimization

The viral coefficient (K-factor) determines whether a referral program drives self-sustaining growth.

**K = i x c** where i = invites sent per user, c = conversion rate per invite.

| K-Factor | Meaning | Growth Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Below 0.2 | Weak referral program | Negligible contribution to growth |
| 0.2 - 0.5 | Decent supplement | 20-50% additional growth on top of other channels |
| 0.5 - 1.0 | Strong referral engine | Significant acquisition channel |
| Above 1.0 | Viral growth | Each user generates more than one new user -- exponential |

**Levers to increase K-factor**:
- Increase invites sent: Prompt at the right moment, make sharing effortless, give multiple sharing options, remind users of unclaimed rewards.
- Increase conversion per invite: Stronger incentive for the referred user, personalized landing pages ("Sarah invited you"), social proof on the referral page, reduce signup friction.
- Reduce time-to-invite: Shorten the time between signup and first referral prompt. The faster users reach value, the faster they share.

### 1.5 Referral Program Page Design

Every referral program needs a dedicated page with:
- **Headline**: Clear value proposition ("Give $20, Get $20" or "Share [Brand] with friends").
- **How it works**: 3 steps, visual, no jargon. Step 1: Share your link. Step 2: Friend signs up. Step 3: You both get rewarded.
- **Unique link or code**: Prominently displayed, one-click copy.
- **Share buttons**: Email, SMS, WhatsApp, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, copy link. Pre-populated messages.
- **Progress tracker**: Referrals sent, pending, completed, rewards earned.
- **Terms**: Clear, concise eligibility rules. What counts as a successful referral.
- **Social proof**: "12,847 people have earned rewards" or testimonials from successful referrers.

> For program framework templates and reward calculators, look up `./references/frameworks-index.csv` and read only the matching file from `./references/frameworks/`. For referral benchmarks and KPI targets, see `./references/benchmarks.md`. For evolving best practices, see `./references/best-practices.md`.

### Reference Lookup Protocol — Program Frameworks

When you need a program framework, template, or calculator:

1. **Read the index**: `./references/frameworks-index.csv`
2. **Match by need**: Use `name`, `description`, `best_for`, `program_type`, or `tags` columns to find the right entry
3. **Read only that file**: Open the file listed in the `file` column (relative to `./references/`)
4. **Never read all files** — load only what the current task requires

**Program types available**: Planning, Referral, Affiliate, Partner, Testing, Reference

## 2. Affiliate Program

### 2.1 Program Setup

1. **Define economics**: Calculate maximum affordable CPA from LTV. Set commission below that ceiling with room for margin.
2. **Choose a platform** (see Section 7.2).
3. **Create program terms**: Commission rates, cookie duration, payment schedule, prohibited methods, brand guidelines.
4. **Build an affiliate portal**: Application form, dashboard, creative assets, tracking links, performance reports, payment history.
5. **Set up tracking**: Pixel-based or server-side conversion tracking. Test end-to-end before launching.
6. **Prepare creative assets**: Banners, email templates, social copy, product images, landing pages, video clips.
7. **Launch**: Seed with 10-20 initial affiliates before public listing.

### 2.2 Commission Structures

| Model | Structure | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| CPA (cost per action) | Fixed fee per sale or lead ($10-$100) | E-commerce, lead gen, defined conversion value |
| Revenue share | Percentage of sale (10-30%) | SaaS, subscriptions, variable order values |
| Tiered CPA | Base rate + bonuses at volume thresholds ($20 base, $30 at 50+ sales/month) | Incentivizing top performers, scaling programs |
| Recurring commission | Percentage of each recurring payment (10-20% for 12 months or lifetime) | SaaS, subscription products, long LTV |
| Hybrid | Base CPA + revenue share bonus, or upfront + recurring | Complex products, balancing affiliate recruitment with long-term alignment |
| First-click vs last-click | Commission to first or last affiliate in the journey | Multi-touch programs, depends on strategy |

**Setting rates**: Research competitors' affiliate programs. Match or exceed their rates to recruit their affiliates. Start generous, optimize down as data arrives. Top affiliates will negotiate -- have a VIP tier ready.

### 2.3 Affiliate Recruitment

**Where to find affiliates**:
- Affiliate networks and marketplaces (ShareASale, CJ Affiliate, Impact marketplace)
- Niche bloggers and content creators covering your category
- YouTube reviewers in your product space
- Newsletter operators with relevant audiences
- Comparison and review sites
- Coupon and deal sites (high volume, lower quality traffic)
- Existing customers who already promote you organically
- Industry communities and forums

**Outreach approach**: Personalized email referencing their content. Explain why their audience fits. Lead with commission rate and cookie duration. Offer exclusive rates or early access for priority affiliates. Provide a quick-start kit with top-converting assets.

### 2.4 Affiliate Onboarding and Creative Assets

**Onboarding package**: Welcome email with program overview and payment terms, dashboard access with tracking links and performance metrics, creative asset library, brand guidelines (voice, do's/don'ts, disclosure requirements), top-converting content angles and examples, point of contact, quick-start guide ("Publish your first promotion in 15 minutes").

**Creative assets to provide**: Banner ads (standard IAB sizes, multiple designs, seasonal updates), email templates (multiple angles with merge fields), social copy (platform-specific with images), co-branded landing pages (convert better than homepage), video clips (demos, testimonials, B-roll), product data feeds (for comparison sites and aggregators).

### 2.5 Tracking and Attribution

- **Cookie-based tracking**: First-party cookies, 30-90 day window. Standard but declining with privacy changes.
- **Server-side tracking**: Server-to-server conversion data. More reliable. Use with Conversions API.
- **Coupon-based attribution**: Unique codes per affiliate. Works cross-channel including offline.
- **Sub-ID tracking**: Affiliates append sub-IDs to track which content or placement converts best.
- **Multi-touch attribution**: Credit split across affiliates in the conversion path. Complex but fair.

### 2.6 Fraud Prevention

| Fraud Type | Detection | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Cookie stuffing | Unusually high click-to-conversion ratio, conversions with no engagement | Server-side tracking, click quality monitoring |
| Self-referral | Affiliate and customer share IP, email domain, or payment method | Cross-reference affiliate and customer data, minimum order thresholds |
| Incentivized clicks | High click volume, low conversion, high refund rate | Monitor refund rates per affiliate, ban incentivized traffic if prohibited |
| Brand bidding | Affiliates bidding on your brand keywords in paid search | Monitor SERPs for brand terms, prohibit brand bidding in terms, use tools like BrandVerity |
| Coupon poaching | Coupon sites claiming last-click credit for organic conversions | Restrict coupon affiliates, use first-click attribution for coupon partners |

**Review cadence**: Audit top affiliates monthly. Review new affiliates weekly for the first 30 days. Investigate any affiliate with refund rates above 15% or conversion patterns that deviate from program norms.

### 2.7 Affiliate Communication

- **Monthly newsletter**: Program updates, new creatives, seasonal opportunities, top performer recognition, optimization tips.
- **Performance alerts**: Automated emails when an affiliate hits a milestone or when performance drops significantly.
- **Dedicated affiliate manager**: For top 10% of affiliates. Regular check-ins, exclusive rates, early access to promotions.
- **Affiliate community**: Private Slack channel or forum for affiliates to share tactics, ask questions, and connect. Builds loyalty and reduces churn.

## 3. Strategic Partnerships

### 3.1 Identifying Partners

**Complementary products**: Products your customers use alongside yours. Shared audience, no competition. **Shared audience, different offering**: Brands targeting the same demographic with non-competing products.

**Discovery methods**:
- Survey customers: "What other tools/products do you use alongside ours?"
- Analyze tech stack overlap (for SaaS): BuiltWith, Stackshare, integration request data.
- Monitor who your audience follows on social media.
- Identify who sponsors the same events, podcasts, and newsletters your audience consumes.
- Check competitor partnerships and replicate or counter.

### 3.2 Partnership Types

| Type | Description | Value Exchange | Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Integration | Build a product integration or connector | Shared users, marketplace listing, co-sell | High (engineering) |
| Co-marketing | Joint campaigns, content, events | Shared audience reach, split costs | Medium |
| Bundling | Package products together at a discount | Combined value proposition, new customers | Medium |
| Channel / reseller | Partner sells your product to their audience | Revenue share, market access | High (legal, ops) |
| Referral | Mutual referral of customers with tracking | Lead exchange, commission | Low |
| Content | Co-author content, guest posts, shared research | Audience crossover, authority | Low |
| Affiliate | Partner promotes with tracked links for commission | Performance-based, scalable | Low-Medium |

### 3.3 Partnership Proposals

A strong partnership proposal covers:

```markdown
# Partnership Proposal: {Your Brand} x {Partner Brand}

## Opportunity
Why this partnership makes sense. Audience overlap, shared goals, market context.

## Mutual Value
What each party gets. Be explicit about the value for THEM, not just for you.

## Proposed Structure
Partnership type, activities, timeline, responsibilities per party.

## Audience Data
Your audience size, demographics, engagement metrics, and customer profile.

## Success Metrics
How both parties measure success. Shared KPIs.

## Next Steps
Specific ask: a 30-minute call, a pilot program, a small co-marketing test.
```

**Approach strategy**: Start small. Propose a low-commitment pilot (a joint webinar, a newsletter swap, a co-authored blog post) before proposing a full integration or long-term deal. Proven results from a pilot make the full partnership case easier.

### 3.4 Revenue Sharing Models

| Model | Structure | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Equal split | 50/50 on joint revenue | Equal contribution partnerships |
| Originator gets more | 70/30 favoring whoever brought the customer | Referral-style partnerships |
| Tiered by volume | Increasing share as volume grows | Long-term partnerships with growth potential |
| Fixed fee per lead | Partner pays or receives a flat rate per qualified lead | Lead-sharing partnerships |
| Commission on influenced revenue | 10-20% on revenue attributed to partner activities | Channel and reseller partnerships |

---

## 4. Co-Marketing

### 4.1 Joint Webinars

45-60 minutes. Each brand presents 15-20 minutes plus joint Q&A. Both brands promote to their audiences. Shared landing page with both logos. Agree on data sharing terms in advance. Follow-up emails staggered 2-3 days apart so attendees are not spammed by both brands simultaneously. If audience sizes differ significantly, rebalance the value exchange (larger partner gets content time, smaller gets lead access).

### 4.2 Co-Authored Content

- **Blog posts**: Joint article on both brand blogs. One writes, other reviews and adds perspective. Cross-link.
- **Research reports**: Co-branded industry research with shared data. Gated download generates leads for both.
- **Guides and ebooks**: Each brand writes sections in their expertise. Joint landing page.
- **Case studies**: Joint customer success story where both products contributed to results.

### 4.3 Cross-Promotions and List Swaps

- **Newsletter swaps**: Each partner features the other to their email list. Never share raw lists -- each brand sends to their own. Track with unique UTMs and dedicated landing pages. Both lists must be opt-in and compliant (CAN-SPAM, GDPR).
- **Social collaborations**: Co-created Reels/TikToks, joint Lives, co-branded hashtag campaigns, account takeovers. Use platform collab features for shared reach.
- **In-product recommendations**: "Works great with [Partner Product]" placement. Mutual placement in both products.
- **Bundle offers**: Combined products at a discount. Exclusive pricing, time-limited for urgency.

### 4.4 Joint Product Launches

Co-branded product or feature launched to both audiences simultaneously. Joint event to unveil. Coordinated PR with simultaneous press releases and social announcements from both brands.

---

## 5. Word-of-Mouth Amplification

### 5.1 NPS-Driven Advocacy

Net Promoter Score identifies who is most likely to refer:
- **Promoters (9-10)**: Actively ask for referrals. Send referral link immediately after NPS survey. "You rated us 10 -- would you share us with a friend?"
- **Passives (7-8)**: Address their specific feedback first. Convert to promoters before asking for referrals.
- **Detractors (0-6)**: Do not ask for referrals -- asking an unhappy customer to refer amplifies negative word-of-mouth. Route to customer success for recovery first.

**Automation**: Trigger referral requests automatically based on NPS score. Promoters get a referral prompt within 24 hours. Passives get a follow-up sequence addressing their feedback. Detractors get escalated to support.

### 5.2 Review Generation

- **Post-purchase review requests**: Email 7-14 days after purchase or delivery. Keep the ask simple: "How was your experience? Leave a review." Direct link to review platform.
- **Platform prioritization**: Google Business Profile (local SEO impact), G2/Capterra (B2B SaaS), Trustpilot (e-commerce), App Store/Play Store (mobile apps), industry-specific review sites.
- **Incentives**: Small discounts or loyalty points for leaving a review. Incentivize the act of reviewing, not positive reviews specifically -- platforms penalize review gating and it risks FTC scrutiny. Platforms penalize incentivized reviews; keep incentives modest and disclosed.
- **Negative review response**: Respond publicly within 24 hours. Acknowledge, apologize, offer resolution. Move the conversation to private channels. A well-handled negative review builds more trust than a deleted one.

### 5.3 Testimonial Collection and Customer Stories

- **Automated collection**: Post-milestone emails. "You just hit [achievement] -- would you share a quick quote?" Ask specific questions, not "write a testimonial": "What was the biggest result?" "What would you tell someone considering us?" "What surprised you?"
- **Video testimonials**: Send a Riverside or Zoom link, or let customers record on their phone. Video converts 2-3x better than text.
- **Case studies**: Identify customers with strong results. 30-minute interview. Structure: Problem > Solution > Results with specific numbers. Publish on website, promote via email and social, use in sales.
- **Permission**: Get written permission for specific use cases (website, ads, social, sales). Store in a testimonial library tagged by use case, industry, result type, and format.

### 5.4 Social Proof Systems

Display aggregate ratings on product pages and landing pages (Trustpilot, Google widgets). Usage counters near CTAs ("Trusted by 12,847 teams"). Customer logo bars on the homepage (ask permission). Media mention badges ("As seen in"). Real-time activity notifications used sparingly and honestly.

### 5.5 Advocacy Programs

Formalize top customers (20-50) as advocates via application or invitation. Activities: write reviews, provide testimonials, speak at events, participate in case studies, refer customers, beta test, join advisory boards. Rewards: early product access, leadership access, exclusive events, merchandise, co-marketing, public recognition. Manage through a dedicated community with monthly touchpoints and quarterly exclusive events.

---

## 6. Viral Loop Design

Design referral mechanics native to product usage, not bolted on:

- **Collaborative features**: Products requiring inviting others to function (shared workspaces, team tools). Each invite is an organic referral.
- **Share-your-results**: Prompt users to share after achievements. Fitness apps sharing workouts, design tools sharing creations, analytics sharing reports.
- **Powered-by badges**: Free-tier outputs include "Made with [Brand]" badge. Each output is a referral touchpoint.
- **Invite-to-unlock**: Features unlock when users invite others. Ensure core value is not gated behind invites.
- **Referral at value moments**: Trigger prompts when the user has just received clear value -- after onboarding, positive support, or usage milestones.

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|---|---|---|
| K-factor | Invites per user x conversion per invite | Above 0.5, ideally above 1.0 |
| Viral cycle time | Time from signup to referral's signup | Minimize -- shorter cycles compound faster |
| Invite rate | Users sending 1+ invite / total active users | 15-30% |
| Invite-to-signup rate | Signups from invites / total invites sent | 10-25% |
| Referral CAC | Total program cost / referred customers | Below 25% of LTV |

- **Unique referral identifiers**: Per-user codes or links persisting through the conversion journey.
- **Cookie + fallback**: First-party cookie for web, coupon code fallback for cross-device.
- **CRM integration**: Sync referral source to CRM for lifetime attribution and LTV analysis.

## 8. Metrics and Measurement

### 8.1 Referral Program Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Healthy Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| Referral rate | Customers who refer / total active customers | 5-15% |
| Viral coefficient (K-factor) | Invites per user x conversion per invite | Above 0.5 |
| Referral CAC | Total program cost / referred customers acquired | 20-50% lower than paid CAC |
| Referral revenue share | Revenue from referred customers / total revenue | 10-30% for mature programs |
| Referral conversion rate | Referred signups that convert to paying / total referred signups | 20-40% (higher than organic) |
| Time to first referral | Median days from signup to first referral sent | Under 30 days |

### 8.2 Affiliate Program Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Healthy Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| Active affiliate rate | Affiliates with 1+ conversion / total affiliates | 10-20% |
| Revenue per affiliate | Total affiliate revenue / active affiliates | Varies by product |
| Effective CPA | Total affiliate payouts / total affiliate conversions | Below target CPA |
| EPC (earnings per click) | Total affiliate commissions / total affiliate clicks | $0.50-$5.00 depending on niche |
| Affiliate churn | Affiliates inactive 90+ days / total affiliates | Below 30% quarterly |
| Refund rate by affiliate | Refunded affiliate sales / total affiliate sales | Below 10% (flag above 15%) |

### 8.3 Partnership Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Partner-attributed revenue | Revenue from customers acquired through partner activities |
| Co-marketing ROI | Revenue or leads from joint campaigns / cost of execution |

| Integration adoption | Users who activate a partner integration / total users |
| Partner satisfaction (NPS) | Partner's satisfaction with the relationship |

### 8.4 Program ROI

**ROI calculation**: (Revenue from program - total program cost) / total program cost x 100. Total cost includes: rewards, commissions, platform fees, staff time, creative production, partner spend. Benchmarks: referral programs 3-5x ROI, affiliate programs 5-10x ROI, partnerships should exceed 2x within 6 months.

---

## 9. Modern and Emerging Practices

### 9.1 Creator-Affiliate Hybrid Programs

The line between affiliates and influencers has dissolved. Modern programs blend both:
- **Creator tiers**: Nano-creators receive product + commission. Mid-tier receive stipend + commission. Top-tier receive retainer + commission + co-creation opportunities.
- **Content + commerce**: Creators produce authentic content that doubles as affiliate marketing. TikTok Shop, Instagram Shopping, and YouTube Shopping enable seamless content-to-purchase journeys.
- **Creator marketplaces**: Platforms like TikTok Shop Affiliate Marketplace, Amazon Influencer Program, and LTK allow creators to self-select products and earn commissions without direct brand outreach.
- **Performance-based scaling**: Start every creator relationship with a commission-only arrangement. Invest in fixed fees only after proven performance.

### 9.2 Micro-Partnership Strategies

Not every partnership requires a formal agreement or months of negotiation:
- **Newsletter cross-mentions**: Simple mutual mentions in newsletters. No formal agreement needed. One email to propose, one to confirm.
- **Social media co-creation**: A single co-created Reel or TikTok. Minimal coordination, shared reach.
- **Podcast guest swaps**: Each founder appears on the other's podcast. Zero cost, high-quality content for both.
- **Shared resources**: Co-create a template, checklist, or tool. Both brands distribute to their audiences.
- **Micro-bundle deals**: Time-limited bundle with a complementary product. Test with one partner before building a formal program.

### 9.3 Community-Driven Referrals

Leverage existing communities as referral engines:
- **Community referral challenges**: Monthly or quarterly challenges where community members compete to refer the most new users. Leaderboards and recognition drive participation.
- **Ambassador programs within communities**: Identify top community members and formalize them as referral ambassadors with exclusive perks and elevated commission rates.
- **User group referrals**: Existing customers form local or industry user groups. Each group becomes a referral hub for peers.
- **Community-exclusive offers**: Referral incentives available only to community members create a sense of privilege and increase program engagement.

### 9.4 Embedded Partnerships (API and Integration-Led)

Product integrations are the most durable partnership channel:
- **Marketplace listings**: Get listed in partner product marketplaces (Slack App Directory, Shopify App Store, HubSpot Marketplace, Zapier). Each listing is a persistent acquisition channel.
- **Integration-first partnerships**: Build the integration first, then layer co-marketing on top. The integration creates shared users who become natural advocates for both products.
- **API-driven referrals**: When users connect two products via API or integration, both products see increased stickiness and natural word-of-mouth.
- **Ecosystem partnerships**: Position your product as essential within a broader tool ecosystem. Become the default recommendation within partner documentation and onboarding flows.

### 9.5 AI-Powered Affiliate Matching

- **Algorithmic partner discovery**: AI tools that match brands with affiliates and partners based on audience overlap, content alignment, and performance prediction.
- **Predictive commission optimization**: AI models that recommend optimal commission rates per affiliate based on their audience quality, historical performance, and conversion patterns.
- **Automated fraud detection**: Machine learning models that flag suspicious affiliate activity in real time -- unusual click patterns, geographic anomalies, conversion timing irregularities.
- **Content-commerce matching**: AI that identifies which affiliate content formats and angles drive the highest conversions for specific products, enabling data-driven creative recommendations.

## 12. Response Protocol

When the user requests referral, affiliate, or partnership marketing work:

1. **Route the starting context first** (see Starting Context Router): blank-page strategy, existing codebase implementation, or live URL audit.
2. **Read strategic context from the best available source**: brand context and SOSTAC first when available; otherwise use the codebase, live site, prior referral deliverables, analytics context, and user inputs.
3. **Clarify scope**: Referral program design, affiliate program setup, strategic partnership, co-marketing campaign, word-of-mouth amplification, advocacy program, implementation work, or full referral strategy?
4. **Assess current state**: Check the resolved path (see Path Resolution) for prior work. If in codebase mode, deeply inspect the relevant implementation files, existing patterns, dependencies, tracking model, and validation path before proposing or making changes.
5. **Deliver actionable output**: Specific program designs, commission structures, audits, implementation plans, partnership proposals, and co-marketing plans -- never vague advice. Every deliverable ties to the brand's economics and audience.
6. **Save deliverables**: Write all outputs to the resolved path (see Path Resolution) when working in the brand workspace.
7. **Recommend the first move**: Which program to launch first, which partners to approach, and what to measure.
