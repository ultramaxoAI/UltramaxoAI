## 3. Integration Architecture

### Core Integration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Simple Stack (Startup/Growth)**
```
Website (WordPress/Webflow)
    |
    v
Analytics (GA4) <--> Email (Mailchimp/ConvertKit)
    |
    v
CRM (HubSpot Free) <--> Forms (Native/Typeform)
```
- Direct integrations between tools (native connectors or Zapier).
- No middleware needed at this stage.
- Zapier/Make.com for bridging gaps: $20-$100/month.

**Pattern 2: Growth Stack (Integration Layer)**
```
Website  -->  CDP (Segment/RudderStack)  -->  Data Warehouse (BigQuery)
                     |                              |
                     v                              v
          Email Automation                   BI / Reporting
          CRM                                (Looker Studio)
          Ad Platforms (via Audiences)
          Analytics (Mixpanel/Amplitude)
```
- CDP acts as the "data spine" — collects events from all touchpoints, routes to all tools.
- Data warehouse stores historical data for advanced analysis.
- Cost: $200-$1,000/month for CDP + warehouse.

**Pattern 3: Enterprise Stack (Full Data Infrastructure)**
```
All Touchpoints  -->  CDP (Segment/Tealium)  -->  Data Warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery)
                                                          |
                                                    Reverse ETL (Census/Hightouch)
                                                          |
                              +---------------------------+---------------------------+
                              |              |              |              |
                          CRM/MAP      Ad Platforms    Personalization  Analytics/BI
                       (Salesforce/    (Google/Meta/     (Dynamic       (Looker/
                        Marketo)       LinkedIn)          Yield)        Tableau)
```
- Reverse ETL activates warehouse data back into operational tools.
- Identity resolution layer unifies customer profiles across touchpoints.
- Marketing mix modeling (MMM) and multi-touch attribution run on warehouse data.

## 5. Build vs. Buy Decision Framework

### When to Buy (SaaS)
- The capability is not a core competitive differentiator.
- A mature SaaS solution exists with strong reviews and integrations.
- Time to value matters more than customization.
- The team lacks engineering resources for build and maintenance.
- Compliance and security are handled by the vendor.
- Total cost of ownership (TCO) of buy is lower than build over 3 years.

### When to Build (Custom)
- The capability is a core competitive differentiator.
- No SaaS solution fits the unique workflow or data model.
- Integration requirements are too complex for off-the-shelf connectors.
- Data sensitivity or regulatory requirements demand full control.
- The organization has engineering capacity and will maintain it long-term.
- Scale economics favor custom (high-volume, low-marginal-cost).

### Evaluation Criteria Matrix
| Criterion | Weight | SaaS Option (Score 1-5) | Custom Build (Score 1-5) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time to deploy | 20% | | |
| Total cost (3-year TCO) | 20% | | |
| Customization needs | 15% | | |
| Integration with existing stack | 15% | | |
| Maintenance burden | 10% | | |
| Data control / security | 10% | | |
| Vendor lock-in risk | 5% | | |
| Team capability to build | 5% | | |
| **Weighted Score** | | | |

### Common Build vs. Buy Decisions
| Capability | Typical Decision | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| CRM | Buy | Mature market, complex to build, strong SaaS options |
| Email platform | Buy | Deliverability requires infrastructure; buy expertise |
| Analytics | Buy + customize | Buy platform (GA4/Mixpanel), customize dashboards |
| Landing pages | Buy | Webflow/Unbounce faster than custom builds |
| Attribution model | Build (on warehouse) | Custom models on your data > generic SaaS attribution |
| Content management | Buy (usually) | WordPress/Webflow unless highly custom needs |
| CDP | Buy (usually) | Segment/RudderStack unless massive scale justifies build |
| AI content tools | Buy | Fast-evolving space; build becomes outdated quickly |
| Data warehouse | Buy (managed) | BigQuery/Snowflake; never build your own warehouse |
| Internal dashboards | Build (on BI tools) | Custom dashboards on Looker Studio or Metabase |

## 6. Stack Audit Checklist

### When to Audit
- Annually (at minimum), or when:
  - Marketing budget is under pressure.
  - Team reports tool fatigue or confusion.
  - Data is inconsistent across tools.
  - New strategic initiative requires new capabilities.
  - Post-merger or acquisition (stack consolidation).

### Overlap Detection
- [ ] List all tools by category. Identify any categories with 2+ tools doing similar things.
- [ ] Common overlaps: CRM + marketing automation, multiple analytics tools, multiple social schedulers, overlapping project management tools.
- [ ] For each overlap: Compare features used, data quality, team preference. Consolidate to one.
- [ ] Check if platform upgrades can replace point solutions (e.g., HubSpot Professional replacing separate email + CRM + landing page tools).

### Cost Optimization
- [ ] Calculate total MarTech spend per month / per year.
- [ ] Calculate cost per tool per active user per month.
- [ ] Identify tools with annual contracts coming up for renewal — negotiate or evaluate alternatives.
- [ ] Check for unused seats (users who have not logged in for 60+ days).
- [ ] Look for free-tier or open-source alternatives for non-critical tools.
- [ ] Aggregate negotiation: Many vendors offer discounts for multi-year commits or bundled products.
- [ ] Target: MarTech spend below 5-8% of total marketing budget.

### Underutilization Signals
- [ ] Tool adoption below 50% of paid features / capabilities.
- [ ] Users logging in less than once per week for daily-use tools.
- [ ] Manual workarounds existing for tasks the tool should automate.
- [ ] Reports being exported and manipulated in spreadsheets instead of used natively.
- [ ] Integrations configured but not actively used for data flow.
- [ ] Training not conducted in the past 12 months.

### Data Quality Check
- [ ] Is customer data consistent across CRM, email, and analytics?
- [ ] Are UTM parameters standardized and consistently applied?
- [ ] Is GA4 event tracking complete and accurate?
- [ ] Are lead sources properly attributed across all tools?
- [ ] Is there a single source of truth for customer records (ideally CRM or CDP)?
- [ ] Are duplicate records being identified and merged?

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] All tools compliant with relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA if applicable).
- [ ] Consent management platform (CMP) in place and properly configured.
- [ ] Data processing agreements (DPAs) signed with all vendors.
- [ ] Access controls reviewed: remove ex-employees, limit admin access.
- [ ] Two-factor authentication enabled on all marketing platforms.
- [ ] Regular audit of API keys and integrations.

### Stack Health Score
Rate each dimension 1-5 and calculate an average:

| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage (all needs met) | | |
| Integration quality | | |
| Data consistency | | |
| Team adoption | | |
| Cost efficiency | | |
| Scalability | | |
| Security / compliance | | |
| Vendor support quality | | |
| **Average Stack Health** | | |

Interpretation:
- 4.0-5.0: Healthy stack. Minor optimizations only.
- 3.0-3.9: Functional but has gaps. Prioritize top issues.
- 2.0-2.9: Significant problems. Plan a systematic overhaul.
- 1.0-1.9: Critical. Stack is actively hindering marketing performance.

## 7. Tool Selection Process

### Step-by-Step Evaluation
1. **Define Requirements**: Document must-have vs. nice-to-have features. Get input from all users.
2. **Research Options**: Identify 3-5 candidates per category. Use G2, Capterra, and peer recommendations.
3. **Shortlist**: Narrow to 2-3 based on feature fit, pricing, and reviews.
4. **Demo / Trial**: Request demos. Run free trials with real workflows (not just sandbox data).
5. **Integration Test**: Verify it connects with your existing stack. Test actual data flow.
6. **Reference Check**: Talk to current customers in similar industries or company sizes.
7. **Negotiate**: Ask for annual discounts, startup pricing, or pilot programs.
8. **Decision**: Score against criteria matrix. Present recommendation to stakeholders.
9. **Implementation Plan**: Document timeline, data migration, training, and success metrics.
10. **Post-Implementation Review**: Check adoption and value after 30, 60, and 90 days.

### Red Flags During Evaluation
- Vendor cannot provide references from similar-size companies.
- No native integration with your core tools (CRM, analytics).
- Pricing jumps dramatically at next tier.
- Contract requires 2+ year commitment with no exit clause.
- Support is email-only with no SLA for response times.
- Data export is difficult or proprietary format only.
- Product roadmap is unclear or focused on features you do not need.
