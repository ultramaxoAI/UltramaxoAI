## 1. Growth Experiment Framework

### 1.1 The Experiment Cycle

Every growth initiative should follow a disciplined experiment cycle:

```
IDENTIFY > PRIORITIZE > DESIGN > IMPLEMENT > MEASURE > LEARN > REPEAT
```

- **Identify**: Generate experiment ideas from data, customer feedback, competitor analysis, and brainstorming.
- **Prioritize**: Score each idea using ICE (or RICE) to rank by expected value.
- **Design**: Write a hypothesis, define success metrics, set duration, and calculate sample size.
- **Implement**: Build the minimum viable test. Speed beats polish.
- **Measure**: Collect data for the full planned duration. No peeking.
- **Learn**: Document results, insights, and next steps -- whether the experiment won, lost, or was inconclusive.
- **Repeat**: Feed learnings into the next cycle.

### 1.2 ICE Scoring Framework

ICE scoring is the standard prioritization method for growth experiments (Sean Ellis, GrowthHackers). Score each experiment idea on three dimensions, 1-10:

| Dimension | What It Measures | Scoring Guide |
|---|---|---|
| **Impact** | If this works, how big is the effect on the target metric? | 1-3: Minor improvement. 4-6: Moderate improvement. 7-10: Step-change or breakthrough. |
| **Confidence** | How confident are we this will work, based on data, precedent, or logic? | 1-3: Pure guess. 4-6: Some supporting data or analogies. 7-10: Strong evidence or proven pattern. |
| **Ease** | How easy is this to implement (time, resources, complexity)? | 1-3: Weeks of work, multiple teams. 4-6: Days, one team. 7-10: Hours, one person. |

**ICE Score** = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3

Rank experiments by ICE score. Run the highest-scoring experiments first. Re-score weekly as new data arrives.

**Common ICE Mistakes to Avoid (2025-2026 Research)**:
- Scoring all ideas in a vacuum without anchoring to a North Star Metric. ICE works best when all ideas are scored against the same strategic objective.
- Letting one person score alone. Use team calibration sessions (3-5 people) to reduce bias.
- Treating ICE as absolute. It is a conversation starter and rough rank, not a precise measurement.
- Scoring too many ideas at once. Batch-score 10-15 ideas per session maximum.
- Not re-scoring after experiments complete. New data should update confidence scores on related ideas.

**Alternative: RICE Scoring** (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort):
- Adds "Reach" (how many users affected) as a fourth dimension.
- Better for product teams with clear user volume data.
- Formula: (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort.
- Use RICE when you have reliable traffic/user data. Use ICE when you do not.

### 1.3 Hypothesis-Driven Testing

Every experiment must start with a falsifiable hypothesis:

```
If we [change/action],
then [metric] will [improve/decrease] by [X%]
because [reasoning based on data or insight].
```

**Good hypothesis examples**:
- "If we add a referral prompt after the first successful project completion, then referral invites will increase by 30% because users are at peak satisfaction."
- "If we create comparison pages targeting competitor brand keywords, then organic trial signups from search will increase by 15% because users searching for alternatives are high-intent."

**Bad hypothesis examples**:
- "If we redesign the homepage, conversions will go up." (No specific metric, no reasoning, no magnitude.)
- "If we post more on social media, we will get more followers." (No mechanism, no target.)

### 1.4 Experiment Velocity

**Target velocity**: 2-3 experiments per week for early-stage teams. 5-10 per week at scale.

Research from growth teams at companies like Booking.com (running 25,000+ experiments/year) and Meta shows that experiment velocity is the single strongest predictor of growth rate. The learning rate matters more than the win rate.

**How to increase experiment velocity**:
- Reduce experiment scope. Smaller tests = faster cycles.
- Pre-build templates for common experiment types (landing page variants, email subject lines, CTA tests).
- Automate measurement. If you have to manually pull data, you will run fewer experiments.
- Kill experiments early when the signal is clearly negative. Do not waste time on obvious losers.
- Separate "big bets" (monthly) from "quick tests" (weekly). Most experiments should be quick tests.
- Maintain a prioritized backlog of 20-30 scored ideas ready to run.

## 2. Product-Led Growth (PLG)

### 2.1 PLG Fundamentals

Product-Led Growth means the product itself is the primary driver of acquisition, activation, retention, and expansion. The product replaces (or supplements) sales and marketing as the growth engine.

**Core PLG metrics**:

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| Time to Value (TTV) | Median time from signup to first value moment | Under 5 minutes for self-serve SaaS |
| Activation Rate | Users completing key action / total signups | 40-60% is good; above 60% is excellent |
| Viral Coefficient (K-factor) | Invites per user x conversion per invite | Above 0.5 is good; above 1.0 = organic viral growth |
| Product Qualified Leads (PQLs) | Users hitting usage thresholds that predict conversion | Varies by product |
| Net Revenue Retention (NRR) | Revenue from existing customers including expansion | Above 110% for SaaS |

### 2.2 Freemium Optimization

The freemium model is the most common PLG acquisition strategy. Optimization principles:

**Feature gating rules**:
- Gate features that deliver advanced value, not features needed to experience core value.
- Users MUST reach the "aha moment" on the free tier before hitting any gate.
- The free tier should be genuinely useful, not a crippled demo.
- Gate collaborative/team features (natural expansion trigger).
- Gate volume/scale features (usage-based upgrade path).

**Usage limit design**:
- Set limits where natural usage growth triggers the upgrade conversation.
- Show usage meters prominently so users see limits approaching.
- Send notifications at 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% of limits.
- Offer temporary limit increases for specific actions (referrals, reviews, social shares).

**Reverse trial model** (gaining adoption in 2025-2026):
- Give full premium access for 14 days, then downgrade to free.
- Users experience premium value, then feel the loss.
- Loss aversion drives conversion better than "try before you buy."
- Companies reporting 2-3x higher conversion rates vs. traditional freemium.

**Conversion triggers**:
- In-app prompts when users hit limits.
- "You've used 90% of your free plan" notifications.
- Feature discovery moments: "This is a Pro feature -- start a free trial to try it."
- Social proof at upgrade moments: "12,847 teams upgraded this month."

### 2.3 Viral Loops

A viral loop is a mechanism where each new user brings in additional users through normal product usage.

**Types of viral loops**:

1. **Inherent virality**: The product requires multiple users to function (Slack, Zoom, Figma).
2. **Collaborative virality**: Users invite others to collaborate (Google Docs, Notion).
3. **Word-of-mouth virality**: Users share because the product is remarkable (ChatGPT, Midjourney).
4. **Incentivized virality**: Users refer others for rewards (Dropbox, PayPal).
5. **Content virality**: User-created content is discoverable by non-users (Canva designs, Loom videos).
6. **Embedded virality**: "Powered by" badges, watermarks, or attribution links (Typeform, Calendly).

**K-factor calculation**:
```
K = i x c
Where:
  i = average number of invitations sent per user
  c = conversion rate of each invitation
```

- K > 1.0: Organic viral growth (each user brings in more than one new user).
- K = 0.5-1.0: Viral amplification (virality supplements other acquisition channels).
- K < 0.5: Minimal viral effect (need to improve loop or rely on other channels).

**Improving K-factor**:
- Increase invitations: Add sharing prompts at moments of delight. Make sharing one-click. Pre-write share messages.
- Increase conversion: Optimize the landing experience for invited users. Show social proof ("Your colleague Sarah invited you"). Reduce friction in the signup flow for referred users.

### 2.4 Activation Optimization

Activation is the moment a user first experiences meaningful value. It is the most important metric in PLG.

**Finding your activation metric**:
1. Identify users who retained long-term (90+ days).
2. Look for common actions they took in their first session or first week.
3. The action most correlated with retention is your activation event.
4. Validate by running experiments that drive users toward that action.

**Activation rate benchmarks (2025-2026 SaaS)**:
- Self-serve SaaS: 20-40% typical, 40-60% good, 60%+ excellent.
- Free trial products: 15-25% trial-to-paid typical.
- Freemium products: 2-5% free-to-paid typical, 5-10% good.

**Tactics to improve activation**:
- Reduce time to value. Every second between signup and "aha" is a dropout risk.
- Use onboarding checklists with progress indicators.
- Pre-populate with sample data or templates so users see value immediately.
- Send activation-focused emails within the first 24-48 hours.
- Use in-app tooltips and guided tours (sparingly -- do not overwhelm).
- Remove unnecessary signup fields. Name and email only. Ask for everything else later.

## 3. Viral Campaign Design

### 3.1 STEPPS Framework (Jonah Berger, "Contagious")

The STEPPS framework identifies six principles that drive virality and word-of-mouth sharing:

| Principle | Description | Application |
|---|---|---|
| **Social Currency** | People share things that make them look good, smart, or in-the-know. | Create content that makes the sharer appear insightful. Insider knowledge, exclusive access, impressive results. |
| **Triggers** | Top-of-mind = tip-of-tongue. Frequent triggers keep your brand in conversation. | Link your brand to everyday triggers. KitKat linked to coffee breaks. Friday = Rebecca Black. Find your trigger. |
| **Emotion** | High-arousal emotions (awe, excitement, amusement, anger, anxiety) drive sharing. Low-arousal emotions (sadness, contentment) do not. | Design campaigns that provoke strong emotional reactions. Surprise, humor, and awe are safest for brands. |
| **Public** | Built to show, built to grow. Visible behavior gets copied. | Make product usage visible. Branded elements, shareable outputs, public profiles, "powered by" badges. |
| **Practical Value** | People share useful information to help others. | Create genuinely useful content: calculators, checklists, templates, how-to guides, data insights. |
| **Stories** | People share narratives, not facts. Your message must be embedded in a story people want to retell. | Wrap your brand message inside a compelling narrative. The brand should be integral to the story, not detachable. |

**Scoring a campaign concept against STEPPS**: Rate each principle 1-5 for your campaign. Campaigns scoring 24+ out of 30 have strong viral potential. Below 18, rethink the concept.

### 3.2 Seeding Strategy

Viral campaigns do not spread by accident. They require deliberate seeding:

**Seeding tiers**:

1. **Inner circle (10-30 people)**: Your most engaged users, superfans, team members, close network. They share on day one because they care about you.
2. **Creator tier (20-50 people)**: Micro-influencers, niche bloggers, active community members with 1K-10K followers. Seed with product, exclusive access, or small compensation ($50-$200).
3. **Amplifier tier (5-15 people)**: Medium-reach creators, journalists, newsletter writers with 10K-100K reach. Provide exclusive angles, data, or experiences.
4. **Platform seeding**: Post natively on 3-5 platforms simultaneously. Optimize format for each platform (vertical video for TikTok/Reels, carousel for LinkedIn, thread for X).

**Seeding timing**:
- Coordinate inner circle to engage within the first 1-2 hours of posting.
- Early engagement signals tell algorithms to distribute further.
- Stagger creator tier engagement over 2-6 hours.
- Amplifier tier can extend over 24-48 hours.

### 3.3 Platform-Specific Virality Mechanics (2025-2026)

**TikTok**:
- Algorithm tests content with 200-500 users first. Optimize for watch-through rate (WTR).
- Hook in first 0.5 seconds. Keep videos under 60 seconds for highest WTR.
- Shares and saves are the strongest distribution signals.
- Trending sounds are distribution channels -- use trending audio within 24-48 hours of emergence.
- Loop-able endings (where the video seamlessly restarts) increase WTR dramatically.
- Post 1-3 times daily for maximum algorithm exposure.

**LinkedIn (2026 algorithm)**:
- Posts shown to first-degree connections first. Network quality > network size.
- Comments beat likes. A post with 20 comments outperforms a post with 200 likes and zero comments.
- External links reduce reach by approximately 60%. Keep content native.
- Document carousels generate 2-3x more dwell time than text or image posts.
- Engagement pods are detected and suppressed. Avoid them.
- 54% of LinkedIn posts are now AI-generated and receive 45% less engagement. Authentic, personal content wins.
- Best formats: personal stories with professional lessons, contrarian takes with evidence, carousels, polls.

**Instagram Reels**:
- Similar algorithm to TikTok: small test audience, then expand based on engagement.
- Shares via DM are the strongest signal for further distribution.
- Reels with original audio can trend if the audio itself is catchy.
- Collaborate feature (co-authored posts) doubles initial reach.

**X (Twitter)**:
- Threads with 5-10 posts outperform single tweets for depth topics.
- Images and video increase engagement but reduce retweets (people share text more).
- Quote tweets with added insight signal quality to the algorithm.
- Community Notes can kill misleading content. Never sacrifice accuracy for virality.

**YouTube Shorts**:
- Shorts feed is discovery-based (like TikTok). Subscribers matter less.
- First 2 seconds determine swipe-away rate.
- Shorts that drive viewers to long-form content are algorithmically rewarded.

## 4. Low-Budget High-Impact Tactics

### 4.1 Community Infiltration (Ethical, Value-First)

**The 90/10 Rule**: 90% pure value contribution, 10% brand-relevant mentions. Violate this ratio and you get banned, ignored, or reported.

**Platform-specific playbooks**:

**Reddit**:
- Join relevant subreddits 4-6 weeks before any brand mention.
- Build karma by answering questions, sharing expertise, and contributing to discussions.
- Study each subreddit's rules and culture. Each community is different.
- When you eventually reference your product, it should be a natural, helpful recommendation in context.
- Never post links to your product as a top-level post. Only mention in comments when directly relevant.
- r/SaaS, r/startups, r/Entrepreneur, and r/smallbusiness are common targets but heavily policed. Niche subreddits often convert better.

**Indie Hackers / Hacker News**:
- Share transparent build-in-public updates: revenue numbers, user metrics, lessons learned.
- Engage with other makers' posts with substantive comments.
- Launch posts ("Show HN", "Show IH") work best when the product is genuinely interesting or novel.
- Hacker News values technical depth and honesty. Marketing speak is punished.

**Facebook Groups / Slack / Discord Communities**:
- Become the most helpful member before any self-promotion.
- Answer every question in your domain within 24 hours.
- Share frameworks, templates, and tools freely.
- After 2-3 months of consistent value, you become the default recommendation.

### 4.2 Newsjacking / Trend Riding

**Definition**: Injecting your brand into a breaking news story or trending conversation to capture attention.

**The newsjacking window**:
```
[Event Happens] -> [Media Reports] -> [Peak Attention] -> [Decline]
                         ^                    ^
                    BEST WINDOW         TOO LATE
                   (2-6 hours)         (24+ hours)
```

**Execution checklist**:
1. Monitor: Set up Google Alerts, Twitter/X lists, and industry news feeds.
2. Evaluate: Does this trend connect to your brand naturally? Force = failure.
3. Create: Produce content within 2-6 hours. Speed beats polish.
4. Distribute: Post on social, pitch to journalists covering the story, share in communities.
5. Measure: Track mentions, traffic spikes, and engagement.

**What makes good newsjacking**:
- Genuine connection to your expertise or product.
- Adds value to the conversation (insight, data, humor).
- Timely -- within the attention window.
- Not exploitative of tragedy, disaster, or suffering.

### 4.3 Product Hunt Launches (2026 Playbook)

Product Hunt remains a powerful launch channel, but the platform has evolved significantly. Only 10% of submitted products get featured on the homepage.

**30-Day Prep Timeline**:

| Timeline | Action |
|---|---|
| Day -30 | Define positioning: one-sentence value prop. Start building email list of 300-500 supporters. |
| Day -25 | Create Product Hunt page assets: tagline, description, images, video demo. |
| Day -21 | Begin outreach to Product Hunt community members. Engage with other launches. |
| Day -14 | Recruit 10-20 "hunters" and supporters who will engage on launch day. |
| Day -10 | Finalize all creative assets. Test the product for launch-day stability. |
| Day -7 | Send preview to supporters. Brief them on launch timing and engagement guidelines. |
| Day -3 | Final email to supporter list with exact launch time and instructions. |
| Day -1 | Pre-schedule social media posts. Prepare response templates for comments. |
| Launch Day | Launch at 00:01 PST. Coordinate engagement. Respond to every comment within 30 minutes. |
| Day +1 to +7 | Follow up with all engaged users. Convert traffic to signups/trials. |
| Day +7 to +30 | Convert launch momentum into sustained growth. Content series about the launch. |

**Key data points (2025-2026)**:
- Average upvotes needed for #1 Product of the Day: ~420 in first 24 hours.
- 65% of upvotes should come in the first 6 hours.
- Tuesday-Thursday launches at 00:01 PST get 34% more visibility than Monday/Friday.
- Successful launches average 12K+ signups and significant first-month revenue.
- Product Hunt explicitly warns against asking for upvotes. Authentic engagement only.
- "Coming Soon" pages are gone. Launch pages and rules changed in 2025-2026.
- Optimize for conversion (signups, revenue), not ranking. Top 5 with no conversion funnel is a vanity win.

### 4.4 Competitive Disruption Tactics

**Comparison pages**: "Us vs [Competitor]" landing pages targeting competitor brand keywords.
- Include factual feature comparison tables.
- Be honest about competitor strengths (builds credibility).
- Target keywords: "[Competitor] alternative", "[Competitor] vs [Your Brand]", "switching from [Competitor]".
- Update pages when competitors change. Outdated comparisons lose trust.

**Counter-programming**: Time your launches, features, or content to coincide with competitor launches. Capture attention while audiences are actively evaluating.

**Price transparency**: If competitors hide pricing, make yours radically transparent. Publish a pricing philosophy. Create "What does [category] actually cost?" content.

**Switching campaigns**: Target competitor users with empathetic messaging. "Frustrated with [pain point]? Here's what [number] people did about it." Include migration tools, switching incentives, and onboarding support.

### 4.5 Build-in-Public

Sharing your journey transparently on social media. Revenue, users, failures, lessons.

**Why it works**:
- Audiences root for transparent founders. Authenticity is rare.
- Each update is a micro-marketing moment that compounds over time.
- Builds trust and credibility before the product is even ready.
- Creates a narrative arc that people follow like a story.

**Platforms for build-in-public**: X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Indie Hackers, personal blog, YouTube.

**What to share**: Monthly revenue updates, user milestones, feature launches, failures and pivots, hiring decisions, customer stories, technical challenges.

**What not to share**: Customer data, security vulnerabilities, internal conflicts, anything that could harm users.

## 5. Digital Guerrilla Tactics

### 5.1 Parasite SEO (Barnacle SEO)

**Definition**: Publishing optimized content on high-authority third-party platforms to rank in search engines faster than your own domain could.

**How it works in 2026**:
- Google's Site Reputation Abuse policy (updated 2024-2025) cracked down on manipulative parasite SEO.
- Ethical parasite SEO still works: publish genuine, high-value content on platforms Google trusts.
- Content on high-DA platforms (YouTube, Medium, LinkedIn, Reddit, Quora) can rank in days vs. months for a new domain.
- Use parasite SEO to build visibility while your own domain authority grows.

**Best platforms for parasite SEO (2026)**:
- YouTube (DA 100) -- video content ranks in both YouTube and Google search.
- LinkedIn Articles (DA 98) -- professional content with social amplification.
- Medium (DA 95) -- long-form content with built-in distribution.
- Reddit (DA 99) -- posts and comments increasingly rank in Google.
- Quora (DA 93) -- answers rank for question-based keywords.
- GitHub (DA 98) -- open-source projects and documentation.
- Substack (DA 90+) -- newsletter content discoverable via search.

**Parasite SEO process**:
1. Identify target keywords where your own site cannot rank quickly.
2. Choose the platform most aligned with the content format and audience.
3. Create genuinely valuable content (not thin, keyword-stuffed pages).
4. Include natural links back to your site where relevant.
5. Engage with comments and community on the platform.
6. Monitor rankings and iterate.

**Risks**: Platform algorithm changes, content removal, account suspension for spammy behavior. Always prioritize genuine value.

### 5.2 Programmatic SEO

**Definition**: Creating hundreds or thousands of web pages automatically using data, templates, and systematic processes.

**Use cases**:
- "[Tool] + [Integration]" pages (Zapier model: one page per integration).
- "[Service] in [City]" pages (local SEO at scale).
- "[Product] vs [Competitor]" comparison pages.
- "[Template] for [Use Case]" pages.
- Directory and aggregation pages.

**2026 best practices**:
- Each page MUST provide unique value. Thin, duplicate pages are penalized.
- Use real data, not just keyword swaps in templates.
- Add user-generated content (reviews, ratings, comments) to differentiate pages.
- Internal linking between programmatic pages builds topical authority.
- Monitor for index bloat -- not every page needs to be indexed.
- AI can generate unique content per page, but human review is essential for quality.

### 5.3 Algorithm Exploitation (Ethical)

Understanding platform algorithms to maximize organic reach:

**LinkedIn (2026)**:
- Dwell time is the new ranking signal -- long-form, engaging content is rewarded.
- Document carousels outperform all other formats for dwell time.
- Comments within the first 60 minutes are critical for distribution.
- Personal profiles outperform company pages for organic reach.

**Google**:
- E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) is the ranking framework.
- AI-generated content is acceptable if it provides genuine value.
- User engagement signals (click-through rate, time on page, pogo-sticking) matter more than ever.
- Topical authority: deep coverage of a narrow topic beats thin coverage of many topics.

**TikTok**:
- Watch-through rate is the primary distribution signal.
- Shares > Saves > Comments > Likes in algorithmic weight.
- Trending sounds provide distribution channels.
- Posting frequency (1-3x daily) increases algorithm exposure.

### 5.4 Cold Outreach Hacks (2025-2026)

**The landscape**: Generic cold emails now convert at less than 1%. AI-personalized outreach achieves 4-12% reply rates. The bar has moved.

**AI-powered personalization at scale**:
- Use AI to research each prospect: LinkedIn activity, company news, tech stack, recent hires, funding rounds.
- Generate unique opening lines referencing specific prospect context.
- Cost per personalized email has dropped to $0.03-$0.15 with AI automation.
- Human-in-the-loop validation: spot-check 10-20% of AI-generated personalization (AI hallucinates 3-8% of the time).

**Multi-channel sequencing**:
```
Day 1: Personalized email (value-first, no ask)
Day 3: LinkedIn connection request with personalized note
Day 5: Follow-up email with relevant resource or insight
Day 8: LinkedIn comment on their recent post
Day 12: Final email with specific value proposition
```

**Subject line data (2026)**:
- Personalized subject lines: 2-3x higher open rates.
- Questions outperform statements.
- 4-7 word subject lines perform best.
- Avoid spam trigger words: "free", "guaranteed", "act now".
- Lowercase subject lines outperform title case in B2B.

### 5.5 Email Signature Marketing

Every employee email becomes a micro-billboard.

**Math**: 50 employees x 30 emails/day = 1,500 daily impressions = 45,000/month.

**Implementation**:
- Rotate CTAs monthly: new product, lead magnet, event, case study.
- Include a small banner image (600x100px) with a tracked link.
- Use tools like Wisestamp, Sigstr, or custom HTML signatures.
- A/B test different CTAs across employee groups.
- Track clicks via UTM parameters on signature links.

## 6. AI-Powered Growth (2025-2026)

### 6.1 AI Content at Scale

**Current state**: AI can produce content 10-100x faster than humans. But 54% of LinkedIn posts are now AI-generated, and they receive 45% less engagement. The differentiator is not AI-generated content -- it is AI-assisted, human-refined content.

**Best practices**:
- Use AI for first drafts, research synthesis, and variation generation.
- Human editing for voice, nuance, personal experience, and accuracy.
- AI-generated content works best for: product descriptions, meta tags, social post variations, email subject lines, ad copy variations.
- AI-generated content works worst for: thought leadership, personal stories, nuanced industry analysis, opinion pieces.
- Always fact-check AI output. AI hallucination rates vary from 3-15% depending on model and topic.

### 6.2 AI Personalization

**Hyper-personalization in 2026**:
- AI analyzes 300+ data points per prospect to generate personalized outreach.
- Combining 3+ personalization layers (behavioral + pain-point + mutual connection) achieves 42% average reply rates.
- Video and image personalization (custom thumbnails, industry screenshots) get 2.8x higher click-through rates than text-only.
- Pain-point personalization (from job postings, reviews, or earnings calls) converts 3.2x better than generic value propositions.

**Implementation stack**:
- Data enrichment: Clearbit, Apollo, ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator.
- AI synthesis: Claude, GPT-4, or similar LLMs to generate personalized elements.
- Delivery: Email automation with dynamic merge fields.
- Validation: Human review of 10-20% sample before sending.

### 6.3 AI Chatbots for Conversion

**Impact**: AI chatbots on websites convert 2-4x more visitors than static forms by engaging visitors in real-time conversation.

**Best practices**:
- Deploy on high-intent pages: pricing, demo request, comparison pages.
- Train the bot on your product, objection handling, and qualification criteria.
- Hand off to humans for complex or high-value conversations.
- Use conversational qualification: ask questions naturally, not as a form.
- A/B test chatbot vs. form on the same page to measure incremental impact.

### 6.4 Predictive Lead Scoring

**How it works**: AI models analyze historical conversion data to predict which leads are most likely to convert, churn, or expand.

**Application to guerrilla marketing**:
- Concentrate high-touch guerrilla tactics (personal outreach, custom content, VIP experiences) on leads with the highest predicted value.
- Use low-touch tactics (automated sequences, community engagement) for lower-scored leads.
- Continuously retrain models as conversion data accumulates.

### 6.5 Automated Trend Detection

**AI-powered social listening** identifies emerging conversations your brand can jump on before competitors.

- Monitor trending hashtags, keywords, and topics across platforms.
- Set up AI alerts for competitor mentions, industry news, and relevant conversations.
- First-mover advantage on trends is measured in hours, not days.
- Tools: Brandwatch, Mention, Hootsuite Insights, custom AI pipelines with social media APIs.

## 7. Measurement & Attribution for Guerrilla

### 7.1 Attribution Methods

| Method | What It Captures | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Unique URLs / QR codes | Direct response from specific tactics | UTM parameters, unique landing pages per tactic |
| Promo codes | Conversion from specific campaigns | Unique codes per channel, stunt, or placement |
| Brand search lift | Awareness impact | Monitor branded search volume before/during/after |
| Social listening | Conversation and sentiment | Track brand mentions, hashtags, sentiment shifts |
| Direct surveys | Self-reported discovery | "How did you hear about us?" at signup or purchase |
| Referral tracking | Viral spread | Unique referral links with conversion tracking |

### 7.2 Proxy Metrics When Direct Attribution Is Impossible

- Branded search volume (Google Trends, Search Console) before and after campaigns.
- Direct traffic spikes correlated with campaign timing.
- Social mention volume and sentiment.
- Organic follower growth rate changes.
- Inbound inquiry volume.
- PR pickup and earned media value.

### 7.3 Key Growth Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| Viral coefficient (K) | Invites per user x conversion per invite | >0.5 good, >1.0 organic growth |
| Activation rate | Users completing key action / total signups | 40-60% |
| Time to value | Median time from signup to first value moment | Minimize relentlessly |
| Referral rate | Users who refer / total active users | 10-25% |
| Experiment velocity | Experiments shipped per week | 2-5 early-stage, 5-10 at scale |
| Customer acquisition cost (CAC) | Total spend / new customers acquired | Compare to LTV for viability |
| CAC payback period | CAC / monthly revenue per customer | Under 12 months for SaaS |

---

## 8. 2025-2026 Landscape Shifts

### 8.1 Customer Acquisition Costs Are Rising

- Paid channel CAC has increased 60%+ over the last three years (Gartner 2026 Digital Marketing Outlook).
- SaaS companies report 25% year-over-year increases in paid acquisition costs.
- This makes guerrilla and organic growth tactics more valuable than ever.
- The startups winning in 2026 are building distribution engines through content, community, product, and social -- not relying solely on paid spend.

### 8.2 AI Is Both Weapon and Challenge

- AI-generated content floods every channel, making human authenticity more valuable.
- AI tools accelerate content production but reduce average quality (oversaturation).
- AI-powered personalization is table stakes for outreach.
- AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) changes how content is discovered and consumed.

### 8.3 Community-Led Growth Is the New Moat
